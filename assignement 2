Write a program to compare two numbers are 
1.equal.
2.Not equal.
3.one num is greater than another one.
4.one num is smaller than another one?
a = 21
b = 10

if ( a == b ):
   print(" a is equal to b")
else:
   print(" a is not equal to b")

if ( a != b ):
   print(" a is not equal to b")
else:
   print(" a is equal to b")
if ( a < b ):
   print(" a is less than b") 
else:
   print(" a is not less than b")

if ( a > b ):
   print(" a is greater than b")
else:
   print(" a is not greater than b")
output:
 a is not equal to b
 a is not equal to b
 a is not less than b
 a is greater than b
